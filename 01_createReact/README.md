react
1.React DOM(website)
2.React Native(mobile apps)

npx stands for Node Package eXecute.
create-react-app->utility(software)
npx create-react-app@latest my-app

but using create react app->it is too bulky and take too much time 


so we crate a react project using vite which is  a bundler


<!-- function->component
file name is not necessory to write in catital letter but good practice
function name should be in capital letter
in create react  jsx or js both are valid -->
