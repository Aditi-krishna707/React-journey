react
<br>
1.React DOM(website)
<br>
2.React Native(mobile apps)
<br>

npx stands for Node Package eXecute.
<br>
create-react-app->utility(software)
<br>
npx create-react-app@latest my-app
<br>
but using create react app->it is too bulky and take too much time 
<br>

so we crate a react project using vite which is  a bundler

<br>
 function->component
 <br>
file name is not necessory to write in catital letter but good practice
<br>
function name should be in capital letter
<br>
in create react  jsx or js both are valid
