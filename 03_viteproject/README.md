The function that we are making and export it as a component what is we write the function on same (no need to export).And it will also work 
<br/>
Myapp() <Myapp/>  both syntex is working<br/>
So the point is that function will work without exporing when we write on same page but when we try to render the object it ill not work because it is not with the syntex React.
<br/>
And when we use React.createElement with react syntex it works
